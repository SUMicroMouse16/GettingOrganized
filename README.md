Some tips i reccommend for all new members to GIT:
Syracuse Gives us a lynda.com account. SPEND TIME WATCHING git essentials. Honestly you will use it for MM
but you will also use it for THE REST OF YOUr LIFE IN ANY JOB THAT IS IMPORTANT. 

Learn about the local vs remote repositories and how their connections are established.
Learn about how collaborating works
Learn how to make commits, fetches, and pushes/pulls.

There are several different repos in this organization.
Many of the repos have working code. Others dont. spend time familiarizing yourself with them.

It may help to take hardware components into account, and "pin" each component with a file for each system you chose.
It may help to make an architectre diagram so you can see the workflow for the mouse.

Spend all resources on getting ONE mouse running first. This is a long term project and you should be contributing to the future of MM.


-Best
